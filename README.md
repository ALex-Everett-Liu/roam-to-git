# How to use it

## Setup

With [pipx](https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx) 
(if you don't know pipx, you should look at it, it's wonderful!)

`pipx install git+https://github.com/MatthieuBizien/roam-to-git.git`

### Create a (private) Github repository for all your notes

With [gh](https://github.com/cli/cli): `gh repo create notes` (yes, it's private)

Or [manually](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo)

Then run `git push --set-upstream origin master`

### Configure environment variables

- `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MatthieuBizien/roam-to-git/master/env.template > notes/.env`
- Fill the .env file: `vi .env`
- Ignore it: `echo .env > notes/.gitignore; cd notes; git add .gitignore; git commit -m "Initial commit"`

## Manual backup

- Run the script: `roam-to-git notes/`
- Check your Github repository, it should be filled with your notes :)

One-liner to run it with a [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) every hours: 
`echo "0 *  *  *  *  '$(which roam-to-git)' '$(pwd)/notes'" | crontab -`
